		<p>The world today is much like the internet only we see real people and only one of them exist. Online we create different personas for different platforms. The world really isn’t much different to the internet as we may think. </em></p>
		The difference between a network and the internet. 

		A network is a group of devices under one network. This is y’all’s created when devices connect to a router. For example house wifi. All devices connect to that router become a network. Within that network the router is connected to other routers which connect the devices to other devices on different networks around the world thus creating the internet.
		<h1>What is it made up of? </h1>
		The physical aspects of the internet include servers, routers, and cables.

				<p>Servers store and provide access to websites and other online content, 

					Servers can be used to manage a network, share files or programs, host databases, and host web pages and e-mail. The server is similar to personal computers. Its components are the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), and hard disk. Servers contain hardware and programs that are tailored to their intended function.
					
					Kinda like cafe and resturant workers or cinema workers who have or are connected to things like film and food… customers are the other devices in that network. It is the workers jobs to give them the best possible experience in their business / server.

		<h3>Routers direct data traffic between devices.</h3>

				<h3>Example</h3>
				<p>Similar to police or signs and street lights directing cars traffic to the right place. Or like gps in cars. 



					Routers connect computers and other devices to the Internet. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel. It connects your business to the world, protects information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others.
					
					
					
					A router is a switching device for networks, which is able to route network packets, based on their addresses, to other networks or devices. Among other things, they are used for Internet access, for coupling networks or for connecting branch offices to a central office via VPN (Virtual Private Network).

						Kinda like when you experience something as a group for example watching a great movie at the cinemas together. You all paid and jumped onto the same plan/ movie/ internet so you get to experience something not many can unless they had access to that film. </p>
